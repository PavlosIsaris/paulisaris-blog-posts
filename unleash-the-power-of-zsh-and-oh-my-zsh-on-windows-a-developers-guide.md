# Windows Command Line Revolution: Unleash ZSH and Oh My ZSH!: A Developer's Guide

## Introduction

Are you tired of the mundane Windows command prompt?

Do you yearn for the flexibility and customization of ZSH but don't
want to deal with the complexities of `WSL` (Windows Subsystem for Linux)?

Well, rejoice, fellow developers, for there is a solution! With the
combination of Git Bash for Windows, ZSH, and Oh My ZSH, you can transform your Windows command line experience into
something truly remarkable.

In this guide, we'll walk you through the installation and configuration of ZSH and Oh My ZSH on Windows, so you can
enjoy the power and flexibility of these tools without leaving the comfort of your Windows environment.

## Embracing ZSH on Windows

### Bash for Windows: Your Gateway to ZSH

Before we dive into the world of ZSH, let's talk about Bash for Windows.
It is the minimal viable solution for running commands on Windows, being slightly more powerful than the traditional and
dreaded CMD.

In this tutorial we will install and use ZSH on top of Git Bash for Windows, which is a lightweight shell that provides
a much improved experience over the default Windows command prompt.

### Introducing ZSH: The Ultimate Shell Experience

`ZSH`, or ***Z Shell***, is a powerful command interpreter for UNIX-like operating systems. It offers advanced features
such as
improved tab completion, spelling correction, and extensive customization options. It's no wonder that many developers
swear by ZSH as their preferred shell.

### Supercharge ZSH with Oh My ZSH!

But what truly takes ZSH to the next level is Oh My ZSH! This open-source framework for managing ZSH configurations
comes packed with a plethora of themes, plugins, and helpers. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting
started, Oh My ZSH! will undoubtedly enhance your command line experience.

## Installation and Configuration of ZSH

Now that we understand the components, let's get down to business. Here's how you can install and configure ZSH and Oh
My ZSH! on your Windows machine without the need for WSL.

### Install Git + Git Bash for Windows

If you haven't already, download and install Git for Windows from the
official website. This will give you access to Git Bash, which serves as the entry point for ZSH. You can find the
Git for Windows installer [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

Git Bash is needed so that we also have the `bash` shell available, which is required for ZSH to run, and also for
having the `~/.bashrc` file available.
The `~/.bashrc` file is installed at `C:\Users\<your user name>\.bashrc`.

### Download ZSH

Once Bash for Windows is set up, it is time to install ZSH:
Download the latest MSYS2 zsh package from the MSYS2 package repository. The file will be named
like: `zsh-#.#-#-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst`. You can find the latest version [here](https://packages.msys2.org/package/zsh).

### Install ZSH

Extract the contents of the zip file (which will include `etc` and `usr` directories) into your `Git
Bash`
installation directory. This will be in `C:\Program Files\Git`. You should merge the contents of the folder when
asked (
**no files should be getting overridden**).

### Verify the ZSH Installation

Open Git Bash and run `zsh --version` to ensure that ZSH is installed correctly.

### Set ZSH as the Default Shell

After installation, set ZSH as your default shell by appending the following to
your `C:\Users\<your user name>\.bashrc` file:

   ```bash
   if [ -t 1 ]; then
    exec zsh
   fi
   ```

### Fix Displaying of Unexpected Characters

Fix the displaying of garbled characters on terminal by appending this line in
your `C:\Users\<your user name>\.bashrc` file:

   ```bash
   /c/Windows/System32/chcp.com 65001 > /dev/null 2>&1
   ```

Close and reopen the terminal, to save those changes. The first time ZSH will ask for some files creation.

## Installation and Configuration of Oh My ZSH! on Windows

As we said earlier, **Oh My ZSH!** is the cherry on top of the **ZSH** cake. Let's see how you can install and configure
it on your Windows machine.
