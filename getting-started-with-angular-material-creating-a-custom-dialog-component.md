## Introduction

Angular is a popular framework for building single-page, interactive applications.

With Angular gaining more popularity, we have the opportunity to use libraries that provide us with built-in UI
components that allow us to focus on the code that will make our app stand out. ;)

In this tutorial, we will examine how to use [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) in order to build a clean
and reusable dialog component.

We will focus on reusability, meaning that we will build a single custom dialog component that we will call when needed
via a service class.
This will help us avoid duplication of HTML templates and CSS classes, as well as
improve [Separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) throughout our app.

You can find the sample project in my [Github repository](https://github.com/PavlosIsaris/Angular-playground)

## Getting started

Before writing any code, we need to set up our project. Angular uses a command line interface (CLI in short) in order to
use its various commands. This tool can be installed as an npm dependency.

We assume that you have npm installed as a global dependency on your system.
You can verify a correct npm installation by running:

```bash
paul@spiderman:~$ npm -v
6.4.1
```

(Yes I name all my computers with Superhero names, isn't that totally awesome?) :D

Great, since we have npm installed, we can go ahead and install the Angular CLI tool:

```bash
npm -g i @angular/cli
```

(-g states that the dependency will be installed globally)

If the installation process finishes successfully, we can use npm to print all global dependencies:

```bash
paul@spiderman:~$ npm -g ls --depth=0

/home/paul/.nvm/versions/node/v10.15.3/lib
├── @angular/cli@7.3.8
└── npm@6.4.1
```

Great! Let's create a playground project to start coding!

```bash
ng new angular-playground
```

After we have selected the desired set up configuration options, we can go to the project's location and start the
project:

```bash
cd angular-playground

ng serve
```

If everything goes according to plan, we should be able to navigate to http://localhost:4200/ and see the default
Angular starting page.

## Adding Angular material to our project

Now, it's time to install Angular material and make use of it's built-in components.

As stated in the [installation guide](https://material.angular.io/guide/getting-started), we use the following npm
command to install Angular Material:

```bash
npm install --save @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations
```

Next, we need to enable animations. Go to `src/app/app.module.ts` and add the following:

```javascript
import {BrowserAnimationsModule} from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';

@NgModule({
    ...
        imports:
[BrowserAnimationsModule],
...
})
```

Also, we need to specify a CSS theme that our application will be using when showing Angular Material components.

We will use the default indigo-pink theme, by adding the following import statement into `src/styles.scss`:

```css
@import "~@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css";
```

Great! Angular Material is set up and ready to be used.

## Creating the custom dialog component

Next, we need to create a new Angular component that will serve as a wrapper to `MatDialog` component, which in turn is
the native dialog component in Angular Material.
The point here is to create a universal Angular component for our app in order to style it as we wish and include any
required business logic code there.

We can use Angular CLI and execute the following:

```bash
ng g c dialog
```

A new component was created in `src/app/dialog/`.
Navigate to `src/app/dialog/dialog.component.html` and delete the boilerplate HTML.

We also need to add the `DialogComponent`  to the `entryComponents` array in `src/app/app.module.ts` class:

{{< gist PavlosIsaris d8eca5a37afdc5b5e9d701f3270d0cef >}}

## Creating the dialog service

We will use Angular Services in order to create a class that will serve as
a [Singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern).
The purpose of this class is

1. Define a way to pass customization data for the dialog component
2. Provide an easy way for every other component to use a dialog component

Again, we can use Angular CLI to create the service:

```bash
ng g s services/dialog
```

Cool, Angular has created our service located at `src/app/services/dialog.service.ts`.

We also need to add this service to the `providers` array in `src/app/app.module.ts` class, since we would like to have
it available app-wide.

The first step is to define an interface with the data that we will be passing each time we need to create a new dialog.
Create a `src/app/shared/dialog-data.ts` to include the following:

```javascript
export class DialogData {
    title: string;
    message: string;
    showOKBtn = false;
    showCancelBtn = false;
}
```

As it is stated in the interface, we can give a custom title and message for the dialog, as well as whether we would
like to also show "OK" and/or "Cancel" buttons.

# Structuring the custom dialog component

It's time to set up the dialog component we created before.
Head to `src/app/dialog.dialog.component.ts` and add the following:

```javascript
import {Component, Inject, OnInit} from '@angular/core';
import {DialogData} from '../shared/dialog-data';
import {MAT_DIALOG_DATA, MatDialogRef} from '@angular/material';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-dialog',
    templateUrl: './dialog.component.html',
    styleUrls: ['./dialog.component.scss']
})
export class DialogComponent implements OnInit {

    constructor(@Inject(MAT_DIALOG_DATA) public

    data: DialogData
,
    private dialogRef: MatDialogRef<DialogComponent>
) {
}

close()
{
    this.dialogRef.close(true);
}
}
```

Next, head over to `src/app/dialog.dialog.component.html` to add the required HTML template:

{{< gist PavlosIsaris 27628325c3f9cdcac151a0c2505d5abc >}}

## Defining the openDialog method

Next up, we need a method in our service that will create and handle the dialog component. Let's add this method
in `src/app/services/dialog.service.ts`:

{{< gist PavlosIsaris 67c3a5d32814436d5ec92d33fe2549e0 >}}

The `additionalDialogConfigData` object passed, is Angular Material optional configuration for our dialog component.

Before creating the dialog component, we check to see whether there is another dialog open, and we close it first.

## Cleaning up app component

Let's add a button (Material style of course) into our app root component, to test our custom dialog.

Head over to `src/app/app.component.html` and delete the boilerplate code.

## Setting up app component

In order to add the button, we need to import `MatButtonModule` into our `app.module.ts` file first:

```javascript
@NgModule({
    declarations: [
        AppComponent,
        DialogComponent
    ],
    imports: [
        BrowserModule,
        AppRoutingModule,
        BrowserAnimationsModule,
        MatButtonModule
    ],
    providers: [],
    bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
```

Add the following to `src/app/app.component.html`:

```html

<div class="wrapper">
    <button mat-raised-button color="primary" (click)="openDialog()">Show dialog</button>
</div>
```

And the following style to `src/app/app.component.scss`:

```css
.wrapper {
    margin-top: 5rem;
    text-align: center;
}
```

We are using an `openDialog` method in our html template. Head over to `src/app/app.component.ts` to define the method:

```javascript
import {Component} from '@angular/core';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    templateUrl: './app.component.html',
    styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss']
})
export class AppComponent {
    title = 'angular-playground';

    openDialog() {

    }
}
```

## Using the dialog service

In our `openDialog` method, we would like to call the `openDialog` method defined
in `src/app/services/dialog.service.ts` file.
In order to do that, we need to use Angular's dependency injection to get an instance of Dialog service in our app
component.

Go ahead and add the dependency in `src/app/app.component.ts` constructor:

``` javascript
import {DialogService} from './services/dialog.service';
.
.
.
constructor(private dialogService: DialogService) {}
```

## Calling the Dialog Service

And now for the fun part!
First, we need to create an object as described in `app/shared/dialog-data.ts` interface.

modify `src/app/app.component.ts` to reflect the following:

{{< gist PavlosIsaris 338955029edbe0176455a73e15a6d7f7 >}}

... and that's it! If we head over to http://localhost:4200/ , we can click on the button and see a clean, natively
styled dialog:

![App Screenshot](/img/angular-material-screenshot.png)

Also, if we open the console, we can see the appropriate logs when we click either the "OK" or the "Cancel" buttons.

You can find the sample project in my [Github repository](https://github.com/PavlosIsaris/Angular-playground)

Awesome, right?

## Conclusion

Angular is a powerful ecosystem for building single page, interactive applications.

Angular Material is a collection of beautifully designed and clean components that you can easily integrate into your
app and can save you countless hours of templating and theming.

When using an Angular Material component, think about how you can abstract it and isolate it even more by using a
service, so that you can easily re-use it throughout your app!
