# Introduction

It's this strange time of the "Social distancing", because of the COVID-19 bizarre situation.

We, as developers, are fortunate enough to be able to still work with little to no severe impacts
in our everyday tasks and projects. Most of us have set-up our home work offices, poured ourselves a cup of
coffee or tea and get cracking with our tasks.

However, with everything that is happening around the world, teams now face the challenge of doing most of their work virtually. Meetings with the team and the clients  code reviews, [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum) events, all work-related social events have been moved to the "virtual world".

What this essentially means, is that we should find a way of remain productive and professional, even in this scenario.
Some of us have been having more experience with this, while some others are just being introduced to the world of virtual meetings, and they need some guidance.
