## Introduction

Often, there is a need to introduce a new developer to the team for a specific project. This on-boarding process is
never easy and sometimes tends to be **painful** for the new member and **frustrating** for the team, which has to keep
working on the already defined tasks without a big impact on their productivity.

Of course, this process differs from team to team and is proportional to the seniority level of the new team member, as
well as the time they have been working at the company.

I will try to keep the following guide as abstract as possible, to accommodate most cases. Keep in mind though to tailor
the recommendations to fit your team's needs and post your thoughts in the comments!

This guide assumes a typical 8-hour workday. It is further divided into subsections, with ideas about what to do during
each time of the day. Feel free to update it according to the habits and ceremonies of your team, to maximize value.

## The 2-day plan

## Day 1

This is the first day that the new team member will start working along with your team. It is a very special day, of
course!
You don't want to stress them or to make them feel lost, even though it is highly likely that they will feel overwhelmed
anyway.
Try to be as cool as possible and not throw deadlines and project reports to their face.
Your job is to make them feel **welcome and productive**.

### Day 1 - Morning:

1. **A short overview of what the business does** (an hour, tops) - understanding how the company makes money is
   important. If the new developer is in the company already, then a brief introduction of the project is in order,
   along with the business side - how the project works and how the client makes revenue.

2. **A short overview of the high-level architecture** (no more than a couple of hours). If the team has already decided
   upon frameworks, Database technologies, 3rd party libraries, or external APIs, this is something that should be
   communicated in time.

3. **A learning plan** for project-specific technologies. The new developer needs to feel not only that they have the
   time required to get up to speed with all the languages and the frameworks, but also that there is no time to slack
   off, or feel **unproductive**.

### Day 1 - Afternoon:

1. **Update on the learning plan;** Questions, answers, and a small update of what has been taught so far. The goal of
   this is that the new developer does not waste time researching everything about the new language/framework, but only
   this 20% that will get them going and become productive, according to
   the [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)

2. **Learning** how to set up a project in the new language/framework. They will need to do that anyway, so it will come
   in handy.

## Day 2

During this day, the new team member should get cracking with **real project tasks**. However, this doesn't mean that
the learning stops. On the contrary, the learning has now a supplementary role, and it becomes less important as the
tasks progress and the developer feels more comfortable.

### Day 2 - Morning:

1. **Project set up and initialization**. If the project has an existing codebase, the new developer will need to clone
   it to their machine, set it up, and get it to compile/build/run (depends on the framework). This is usually not easy,
   and every other developer on the team needs to pay attention here.<br>
   Often, this process reveals a lack of proper documentation of the project. Developers sometimes assume things,
   especially for the installation/set-up procedure of a project. So this is an excellent opportunity to revamp the
   documentation of the project and make sure that there are no assumptions.

2. **A specific task** which gets them familiar with just one or two files in the codebase, done with one of the more
   experienced programmers sitting with them to help 1:1. It is crucial for a new developer not to feel alone on a
   task.<br>The best strategy is to assign them to a task that only exposes them to as few files as possible so that
   they don't feel lost.

### Day 2 - Afternoon:

1. **A couple of short specific tasks** with an experienced programmer dedicated to helping a “small group of
   starters” (typically 2–3).

2. **Flying solo on a small task**, but knowing that they can ask for help [this never stops.

3. **Repeat**, with increasingly larger tasks, covering more of the codebase.

At this point, the new developer should already feel comfortable and productive. However, remember that as the
difficulty of the tasks increase, they may feel overwhelmed again, and that's usually when
the [Impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) occurs.<br>So, it becomes obvious that the new
team member should feel free to ask any questions, no matter how "stupid" or "obvious" they may seem.

To conclude, adding a new member to a software team **is not an easy task**. Sometimes we forget how important the
onboarding process can be, resulting in **poor estimates** (as the on-boarding is hugely underestimated), Impostor
syndromes, and confusion for the entire team.
Having a solid and effective on-boarding plan is crucial as it ensures both **productivity** and **good morale** for the
**entire team**.
